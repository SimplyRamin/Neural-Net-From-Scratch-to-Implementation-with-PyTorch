# NN-Implementation-Scratch-PyTorch
 Greetings,
 
 In this Repository, I have implemented a simple linear regression neural net.
 there are 4 different models of same NN implemented in this repo.
 first model is implemented without using the PyTorch library.
 second model's gradient computation step is implemented with AutoGrad and other parts are all from scratch.
 third model's gradient computation step is implemented with AutoGrad, Loss Computation is implemented with PyTorch Loss and Parameters update is implemented with PyTorch optimization.
 fourth model is all implemented with PyTorch. there are 2 iterations of fourth model, first one is using simple Linear layer function of pytorch and the other one is using custom class for NN also from pytorch.
